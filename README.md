# Pest Guard
Pest Guard is a desktop application for gardeners to identify pests and weeds in their garden, what pesticide solutions will counter those pests, and what nearby stores can supply those solutions. You may filter the pesticides to include only environmentally friendly options, or options non-toxic to pets or children.

Pest Guard was created for CS 422: UI Design in Fall 2023 at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
